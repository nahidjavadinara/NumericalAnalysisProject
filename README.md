## Resolution of a 2D Poisson problem *** 
### Introduction

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of numerical methods to solve the 2D Poisson problem. The Poisson equation, a cornerstone in fields like electrostatics, fluid mechanics, and heat conduction, is discretized using finite difference methods and solved over a square domain. The project focuses on both theoretical understanding and computational performance, offering insights into direct and iterative solvers.
