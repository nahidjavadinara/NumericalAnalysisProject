## Resolution of a 2D Poisson problem 
### Introduction

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of numerical methods to solve the 2D Poisson problem.  

The project focuses on both theoretical understanding and computational performance, offering insights into direct and iterative solvers.

*** Objectives ***

Finite Difference Discretization: Derive and implement a discrete version of the 2D Poisson equation, validate the solver using a known exact solution, and analyze convergence and computational efficiency.
Linear System Solvers: Explore both direct and iterative methods for solving the resulting linear system, comparing computational costs and performance.
Extensions and Enhancements: Incorporate additional features such as diffusion terms, higher-order finite difference schemes, and advanced boundary conditions.
